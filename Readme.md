# Jenkins Custom Distribution Service

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/cfca19d2dff84c6290765df4bd5859c3)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/jenkinsci/custom-distribution-service?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=jenkinsci/custom-distribution-service&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

The main idea behind the project is to build a customizable jenkins distribution service that could be used to build tailor-made jenkins distributions. The service would provide users with a simple interface to select the configurations they want to build the instance with eg: plugins, authorization matrices etc. Furthermore it would include a section for sharing community created distros so that users can find and download already built jenkins war/configuration files to use out of the box.
